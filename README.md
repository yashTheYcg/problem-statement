# problem-statement

Here frontend is running at http://localhost:3000
and 
backend is running at http://localhost:8080

I have not given the feature of selecting time slot,
but I have fetched all data from demo data - "order.json" and update it and write in the new json file named -"updatedOrder.json"
I have used context in React js for phoneNumber and editing the currentOrder
I have used core module,express module, node module in backend

I have not added alert message but it can be seen in terminal, if I have more time I can add that too.
